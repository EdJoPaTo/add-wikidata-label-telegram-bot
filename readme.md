# Add Wikidata Label Telegram Bot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EdJoPaTo/add-wikidata-label-telegram-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/EdJoPaTo/add-wikidata-label-telegram-bot)

Two users of my [Bastion Siege Clone](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/bastion-siege-clone) asked about adding labels in their native language [Amharic](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28244).
Apparently they never connect their laptops to a network and use their Smartphones to get the data from and to their Laptops (when needed).
Editing Wikidata with the mobile layout isn't that easy and I used this as an excuse to take a look at [wikidata-edit](https://github.com/maxlath/wikidata-edit).

They were not the only users adding labels to Wikidata besides me.
Also several other users from all over the world at least asked how to do it. ðŸŽ‰

This bot is made the spartan way.
It works for the desired purpose but thats it.
If you are looking how to do proper Telegram Bots (I know you guys are out there checking my repos ðŸ‘‹) you should take a look at the [Bastion Siege Clone](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/bastion-siege-clone) itself or my other Bot projects.

As this bot is only an experiment for this specific usecase it is not hosted anywhere.
Modify it to your needs or test it with [Q4115189](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4115189) for yourself.

If you think this bot is worth an upgrade to be used in general this bot should work with [OAuth](https://github.com/maxlath/wikidata-edit/blob/master/docs/how_to.md#config) and the account provided by the user.
